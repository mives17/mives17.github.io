      Hello My name is Michael Ives and I am a postgraduate student at the University of Leeds. 
      Please see below a link to my repository. <A href="https://github.com/mives17/Assessment1GH">Repository</A> 
         
    There are two separate agent based models. BasicAss1.py is run with in.txt to form a basic model in which agents move around their environment and a history of their movement can be seen Ass1.py is the main class of the second model, while agentframework.py deals specifically with the agents. It also runs with in.txt. 
         In this model, agents move around their environment, eat their environment and interact with each other
