Hello

My name is Michael Ives and I am a postgraduate student at the University of Leeds. <br>

Please see a link below to my repository.   <br>

<A href=https://github.com/mives17/Assessment1GH>Repository</A>   <br>

There are two separate agent based models. <br>

BasicAss1.py is run with in.txt to form a basic model in which agents move around their environment and a history of their movement can be seen. <br>

Ass1.py is the main class of the second model, while agentframework.py deals specifically with the agents. It also runs with in.txt. <br>
         
In this model, agents move around their environment, eat their environment and interact with each other. <br>
