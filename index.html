<p>My name is Michael Ives and I am a postgraduate student at the University of Leeds.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />There are two separate agent based models.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BasicAss1.py is run with in.txt to form a basic model in which agents move around their environment and a history of their movement can be seen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ass1.py is the main class of the second model, while agentframework.py deals specifically with the agents. It also runs with in.txt.&nbsp;<br /> <br />In this model, agents move around their environment, eat their environment and interact with each other.&nbsp;</p>
